# GD_IRLS_MATLAB
These codes are related to an improved parameter estimation of HFM signals based on IRLS linear fitting of extracted group delay.
MonteCarol_versusDifferentNandSnr is a main program for comparing the results that different length Ns perform on the algorithm versus several SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation.
singleHFMsimulation is another main program for the step-by-step presentation of the algorithm.
GD_IRLS is a canned program for estimating the frequency parameters of HFM signals.
